Abstract:Breast cancer is a complicated and variable illness with a wide range of morphological traits and clinical outcomes. As a result, patients with breast cancer may respond to various therapy choices. Currently, difficulties in identifying breast cancer types result in ineffective treatments. In general, breast cancer is classified as either malignant or benign. As a result, it is required to develop a clinically useful disease categorization that can reliably categorize breast cancer tissues. The purpose of this work is to classify breast cancer lesions received through a fine needle aspiration (FNA) operation using random forest. Random forest is a classifier constructed on the combination of decision trees and has been discovered as performing well in comparison to other Machine learning techniques. This approach was tested on roughly 700 data points, including 458 benign cases and 241 malignant ones. The performance of the suggested technique is evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The testing results suggest that random forest attained a sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 70%, and accuracy of approximately 95%. Furthermore, a comparison with previous techniques reveals that, while previous methods had respectable accuracy rates, the random forest classifier outperforms them significantly, demonstrating its superior ability to accurately classify breast cancer types with fewer features. This improved performance emphasizes the promise of random forest as a promising tool for discriminating malignant and benign tumors at an early stage,this leads to more efficient treatment strategies.
